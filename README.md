*Asawa* is a renowned business specializing in accommodation and catering services for corporate agencies in Ghana. Located in the Eastern Region, they serve over *250,000* clients annually.

I was consulted by their Product Manager a few weeks ago to facilitate launching their Official Website. It is an honor for me as a freelancer to handle something this big.

It is a WIP at the moment, so watch this space!

## Not working:

* Form submissions (Subscription): Converting standard MailChimp subscriptions to XHR-format posing a challenge, mainly due to handicap in PHP.

* Booking/Reservation System: Possibly back-end related, but can learn basic database to get rolling.

*Note*: Could afore-mentioned XHR problem rear it's ugly head even after?
