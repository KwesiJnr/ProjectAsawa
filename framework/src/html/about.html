            <p>"<em>Asawa</em>" in English means cotton. Yes, we strive to make your stay as comfortable, soft and
                seamless as cotton wool.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Founded in 1994 by a group of entrepreneurs on the coasts of the Eastern Region of
                Ghana, we serve over 250,000 global clients annually.</p>

            <p>Conjuring up visions of grandeur and luxury, the Asawa Resort is the ideal getaway
                offering a secluded, intimate and serene ambience specially designed for absolute comfort and
                relaxation.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>
                The resort is located next to and looks directly across a vast landscape, complete with two
                awe-inspiring
                mountains and provides an excellent range of accommodation and facilities, whilst ensuring
                unrivaled privacy to guests.</p>

    <h2 class="panel__hd">Vision</h2>
    <div class="panel__desc">
        <p>Our mission is to always offer enjoyable and new experiences to our clients, with the objective to obtain
            maximum satisfaction. To do this, we work hard on the quality of our products, services and facilities,
            through constant improvement of our work processes.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>We are a benchmark resort company in Ghana, and aspire to be one of the
            best in Africa. Our working strategy requires continual adaptation within our development
            framework, in which we engage our
            customers, employees and partners, always striving for a balance between profitability and social
            benefit.

    <h2 class="panel__hd">Your Home, Away From It All</h2>
    <div class="panel__desc">
        <p>We have all the comforts of home — comfortable beds, great living space, a fully-equipped kitchen and a
            solid
            sound
            system — all in the privacy of your personal space, surrounded by breathtaking scenery.
            <br><br>
            One of the best things about our rooms is that every room has been specially designed in such a way that
            every
            individual gets a glimpse of the beautiful surroundings just by taking a look out the window.
            No searching for the perfect room or haggling over prices for the best one — all our rooms are just
            perfect!
            (depending, of course, on what plan you paid for :D )</p>
