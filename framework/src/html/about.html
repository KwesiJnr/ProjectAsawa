            <div class="">
                <p>Asawa was founded in 1994 by a group of entrepreneurs on the coasts of the Eastern Region of
                    Ghana.</p>
                <p>Conjuring up visions of grandeur and luxury, the Asawa Resort is the ideal getaway
                    offering a secluded, intimate and serene ambience specially designed for absolute comfort and
                    relaxation.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    The resort is located next to and looks directly across a vast landscape, complete with two great
                    mountains and provides an excellent range of accommodation and facilities, whilst ensuring
                    unrivaled privacy to guests.</p>

            <p>We have all the comforts of home — comfortable beds, great living space, a fully-equipped kitchen and a
                solid
                sound
                system—all in the privacy of your personal space, surrounded by breathtaking scenery.
                <br><br>
                One of the best things about our rooms is that every room has been specially designed in such a way that
                every
                individual ets a glimpse of the beautiful surroundings just by taking a look out the window.
                No searching for the perfect room or haggling over prices for the best one — all our rooms are just
                perfect!
                (depending, of course, on what plan you paid for :D )</p>
